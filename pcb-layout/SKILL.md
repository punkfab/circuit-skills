The north star: **routing difficulty is decided at placement time, and every autorouter is immature.**
So you don't hunt for a smart router — you **design so routing is trivial** (modular blocks, ground
pours, deliberate placement, code-placed decoupling) and **hand-finish the stubborn tail**. tscircuit's
real value is *code-driven generation and placement*, NOT its routing; KiCad's real value is *routing*.
Use each for its strength. (Simulate the circuit first with the **circuit-sim** skill; this skill starts
once the topology and values are fixed.)

## Tool choice (decide once)

- **Eagle is dead** — Autodesk sunset standalone Eagle (folded into subscription Fusion 360 Electronics).
  Don't start there.
- The real axis is **code-first (tscircuit)** vs **GUI (KiCad)**. They split on routing: tscircuit
  generates a placed, mostly-routed board from code; KiCad routes interactively and well.
- **Pick a path:**
  - *Plain KiCad* — if reliably finishing boards is the priority. Free, mature router, best JLC support.
  - *tscircuit-generate → KiCad-finish* — if AI/code-reproducible/**many-variants** is the priority.
    `tsci export -f kicad_pcb` → placement + pours + ratsnest → hand-route in KiCad. **One-way per board**
    (no clean round-trip back to tscircuit code).
- A prior project died on **Freerouting** (the autorouter), not KiCad — KiCad's *manual* routing is great.
  "Every autorouter is immature" ⇒ route by hand in a tool that's good at it. **BUT** Freerouting 2.x is
  worth trying as a *finisher on a well-placed board*: measured, it completed flexisette to **0 unrouted
  in ~5 s with 45° traces** where sequential-trace stalled at ~10. Its weakness is large/dense boards +
  trace quality — so it complements the "good placement → trivial routing" north star, it doesn't replace
  it. See [Finishing the routing tail](#finishing-the-routing-tail) → `scripts/freeroute.sh`.

## Setup (tscircuit)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash          # tsci needs bun (~/.bun/bin/bun)
npm install -D tscircuit @tscircuit/cli @types/react
export PATH="$HOME/.bun/bin:$PATH" && npx tsci init -y   # scaffolds + installs an AI skill at .claude/skills/tscircuit
```
`tsci init` drops an authoritative skill at `.claude/skills/tscircuit/` (SKILL/SYNTAX/elements/*) — read it.

## Workflow

1. **Stock-check parts first.** `tsci search --jlcpcb "<q>"` — read the stock number; <~200 is a supply
   risk for a board you'll reproduce. Swap now, not after layout. (Real swaps on sbs-synth: BS8116A-3
   touch IC had 25 in stock → MPR121; RP2354A had 184 → RP2350A + external W25Q16 flash.)
2. **Import real parts** — `tsci import "C<lcsc#>"` writes `imports/<Part>.tsx` with the true footprint +
   pin labels + JLC part number. Never hand-model a QFN.
3. **Author each functional block as its own module** (`modules/<name>.circuit.tsx`) — see Modular below.
4. **Validate connectivity** cheaply: `tsci build <f> --disable-pcb --schematic-svgs`; fix "missing
   trace"/"no ports" before any PCB work.
5. **Route each block in isolation** with `sequential-trace`; iterate placement until clean or a small tail.
6. **Compose** blocks as placed `<subcircuit>`s; wire only the inter-block buses at top level.
7. **Export** `tsci export -f kicad_pcb`, finish routing + DRC in KiCad, generate Gerbers/BOM/CPL.

## Modular vs non-modular (decide per board)

- **Non-modular (one flat board, no subcircuits)** — default for low/medium part counts. ONE net scope,
  so shared signals are naturally single nets (no fragmentation), and since Freerouting routes the whole
  board anyway, it's the simplest path. Use it unless the design is big/dense enough to choke the
  tscircuit PCB pipeline.
- **Modular (`<subcircuit>` blocks)** — for dense boards: a monolith (60-pin QFN + ~50 parts) **chokes
  the tscircuit PCB pipeline** (100% CPU for 10+ min, 0 traces). Blocks place + route independently. The
  cost: tscircuit scopes `net.X` PER subcircuit, so a signal shared across blocks exports as several net
  codes that KiCad flags as FALSE shorts — you MUST reconcile them after export (see below).

Each module exports a placeable block AND a standalone board:
```tsx
export const McuBlock = ({name="mcu", pcbX=0, pcbY=0}: any) => (
  <subcircuit name={name} pcbX={pcbX} pcbY={pcbY} autorouter="sequential-trace">
    {/* parts + internal traces + a pinrow breakout header + a bottom GND pour */}
  </subcircuit>)
export default () => (<board width="50mm" height="46mm"><McuBlock/></board>)   // standalone build target
```
Compose with top-level bus traces via qualified selectors; **account for each block's real extent** or
they overlap (sbs-synth's touch block was ~108 mm wide → its own bottom band):
```tsx
<board width="130mm" height="75mm" autorouter="sequential-trace">
  <TouchBlock name="touch" pcbX={0} pcbY={-21}/> <McuBlock name="mcu" pcbX={-2} pcbY={19}/> ...
  <trace from=".mcu .J_IO .SDA" to=".touch .J_TOUCH .SDA"/>   {/* buses only */}
</board>
```

**Reconcile cross-block nets (`scripts/merge_nets.py`) — the "overview pass that matches nets by name".**
tscircuit names a shared signal differently in each scope — `SDA`, `SDA`, `"J_OLED.SDA to net.SDA"`,
`SDA_source_net_8` — so after routing KiCad reports them as `shorting_items` (same copper, different net
names). `merge_nets.py` collapses every same-base-name net to ONE canonical net in the exported
kicad_pcb, BEFORE routing (a file transform — pads can't be re-netted over IPC). Name shared signals
consistently (`net.SDA`, `net.GND`, `net.BCK`) in every module — **chip pin AND breakout-header pin both
to the named net** — so they reconcile cleanly. On flexisette this turned 19 false shorts into 0.

## The routing recipe (what makes it route)

1. **Ground/power pours** — `<copperpour connectsTo="net.GND" layer="bottom"/>` removes 60-70% of nets.
   Prefer **per-block** pours; a board-level pour can *fight* bottom-layer signals.
2. **`autorouter="sequential-trace"`** on every board/subcircuit. The default **capacity-mesh fails at
   any size** ("AD ran out of iterations", 0 traces) and can hang. sequential-trace is dumb but
   *predictable* — routes fast or fails fast, never spins.
3. **Explicit `footprint` on EVERY part** incl. `<pinheader footprint="pinrow4">` and
   `<pushbutton footprint="pushbutton">`. The builtin `<connector standard="usb_c">` has no footprint →
   import a real USB-C part (e.g. TYPE-C-31-M-12, C165948).
4. **Declaration order matters** for the greedy router — declare the hardest nets first (e.g. inner QSPI
   pins) so they claim direct paths before outer pins block them.
5. **Stitch QFN center/thermal pads to the pour** with explicit `<via connectsTo="net.GND" .../>` inside
   the pad — the router won't.

**Ground truth is the log, not trace counts.** `"1 passed"` + a high pcb_trace count ≠ routed:
`grep -c 'Could not find a route' build.log`. On the exported KiCad board, the real check is
`kicad-cli pcb drc <f>.kicad_pcb` (counts unconnected items AND clearance/short violations).

## Placement is the whole game

This is where the time goes and where tools are worst (parts dumped at origin, decoupling orphaned).

- **Edge-aware placement (the 4× lever).** Put each support part on the QFN edge its signals exit. Look
  it up: `grep 'portHints=\["pin60"\]' imports/RP2350A.tsx` → x/y → which edge. On sbs-synth's RP2350A,
  moving the flash from *below* to *above-left* (where the QSPI pins are) went **16 → 3 unrouted**, same
  parts/router/nets.
- **Code-place decoupling — never by hand.** Ship `scripts/genpinmap.mjs` (parses `imports/*.tsx` →
  `lib/pinmap.json`: every pin label → footprint x/y) and `scripts/place.tsx` (the `Decap` helper):
  ```tsx
  <Decap name="C1" part="RP2350A" ic={U1} pin="IOVDD1" layer="bottom"/>
  <trace from="C1.pin1" to="net.V3V3"/><trace from="C1.pin2" to="net.GND"/>
  ```
  Places the cap at the real power-pin coordinate — zero hand-guessed numbers, reproducible across
  variants. **Default `layer="bottom"`** for dense QFNs: caps under the chip are co-located AND free the
  top layer for escape (measured: 6 caps top-side → 11 unrouted; same 6 bottom-side → 6).
- **Don't trust tscircuit's auto-layout.** `<group layoutMode="pack">` **stacked parts on the origin** in
  testing — immature. Use the code helper.
- **Clustering heuristic:** a 2-pin passive whose nets are only `{one IC pin, power/GND}` belongs to that
  IC → place adjacent. Captures ~all decoupling/pull-ups.
- **Floorplan by signal flow:** power → MCU → peripherals → connectors; pin connectors/jacks/mounting
  holes to board edges *first*. This is the only real eyeballing — ~5 coordinates.
  - **If the board goes in a printed/CNC enclosure, the shell openings constrain placement** — pin each
    connector to its shell-slot coordinate and the display to its window BEFORE the rest, then verify in
    3D. See the **pcb-enclosure-fit** skill (export board → register to the printed parts → render a
    fit-check → gate placement on cutout/connector/screw alignment).
- **Connectors + user controls live on EDGES, oriented outward.** A USB-C / barrel / jack must sit on
  the board edge with its mouth facing off-board (a connector floating mid-board or rotated inward is
  un-mateable — a common AI-placement bug). Buttons/switches the user presses go on an accessible edge.
  Place + orient these by hand first; they're the fixed reference the rest hangs off.
- **Lock the anchors, float the rest.** What the enclosure/mechanics fix in place — connectors, mounting
  holes, an edge button, a display — are ANCHORS: place them deliberately and don't let an autoplacer or
  sweep move them. Everything else (the MCU module, regulators, passives) is MOVABLE — that's what you
  iterate. State this split explicitly so a placement pass only nudges the floaters.
- **Communicating blocks belong on the same side.** Inter-block buses route *between* blocks; if two
  blocks that talk (MCU↔codec) sit on opposite sides of a big obstacle (a board cutout, a connector
  bank), the bus has to detour around it and unrouted spikes. Put talkers adjacent; keep cutouts/holes
  out of the bus channels (on flexisette, mcu-left ↔ audio-right across a hole-filled centre was the
  whole routing problem — a floorplan fix, not a router fix).
- **On a cutout-heavy outline, MAP THE CLEAR REGIONS FIRST.** Before placing, subtract the holes + the
  notch from the board and note what's left — usually a few bands/ends/strips (flexisette: a top band,
  two narrow end columns beside the reels, a thin strip below the holes/above the notch). Then fit each
  block to a region it actually *fits*. This is the difference between converging and thrashing.
- **Narrow a too-wide block to fit a narrow region** — don't fight a 33mm block into a 24mm column.
  Stack a chip's support parts *above/below* it instead of *beside* it (mcu went 33→21mm wide by moving
  the reset/boot passives above the WROOM), and reposition a long breakout header off the obstacle.
- **Drop redundant parts that hog edge real-estate.** On a tight board, question every connector/button:
  modular **breakout headers** are pointless once buses route chip-to-chip via reconciled named nets;
  **reset/boot buttons** are pointless with native-USB (esptool resets over USB-CDC). Removing
  `J_IO/J_I2S/J_PWR` + `SW_RST/SW_BOOT` freed ~40mm and took flexisette from 14 courtyard overlaps to 0.
- **Gate on the COURTYARD, not the eyeballed body size.** Module/IC keepouts are bigger than the part
  (the ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 antenna keepout extends well past the metal), so two parts that "look" clear
  still collide. `drc_check.py` courtyard is the truth; chase it, not your mental bbox.
- **The board-outline rule — `scripts/outline-check.mjs` (run it after every floorplan move).** tscircuit
  has **no keep-in constraint**: `pcbX/pcbY` is manual, so a block can land in a concave **notch**, off
  the edge, or inside a **`<cutout>`** and you won't see it — tscircuit emits `pcb_component_outside_
  board_error` but the build only prints a generic "Build completed with errors", and it does *not* flag
  parts sitting in a cutout. `outline-check` surfaces both (parses the built `circuit.json`) and exits
  nonzero. It's the placement analog of `routecheck`: nudge a block, re-run, drive the count to 0. (On a
  non-rectangular outline — a cassette, a notched enclosure — this catches the bug every time: e.g. a
  power block floor-planned into the bottom head-access notch read as 16 parts off-board.)
- **KiCad placement aids:** "Pack and Move Footprints", place-by-hierarchical-sheet, and the **Replicate
  Hierarchical Layout** plugin (lay out one repeated channel, replicate to all — ideal for key arrays +
  variants).

## Round-trip floorplan loop (the fast early-design loop + variants)

tscircuit→KiCad is one-way for *routing*, but **part positions round-trip cleanly** — and that's where
the early design time goes (drag a part, look at the ratsnest, repeat). Keep positions as **data**, not
buried in `pcbX/pcbY` literals, so you can hand-place visually AND fork per-release variants. Two
bundled scripts (`scripts/sync_positions.py`, `scripts/apply_placement.py`) are the round-trip:

```
make place  [VARIANT=glow]   # tsci export (rough) -> apply placement/<V>.json -> open pcbnew
   ── drag + ROTATE parts by eye against the ratsnest/DRC (rotation is captured) ──
make sync   [VARIANT=glow]   # read the board's footprint (at x y rot) -> placement/<V>.json
make variant V=glow          # fork the current placement into a new release
```

- **It's PRE-ROUTING and runs on a throwaway board** (`build/floorplan.kicad_pcb`) so the routed board
  is never at risk; no re-route needed while you're only moving parts. `route.sh` then `apply_placement`s
  the saved `placement/<VARIANT>.json` right after export, so the floorplan feeds the real route.
- **Positions are stored in the tscircuit-centred frame** (board-outline bbox centre maps KiCad mm ↔
  design mm; on flexisette that centre is (100,100), so `tx = kx−100, ty = 100−ky`). Derive the centre
  from the outline so it works on any board.
- **Format gotcha:** a *fresh* `tsci export` writes `(layer F.Cu)` (unquoted, name on the next line); a
  KiCad-*saved* board writes `(layer "F.Cu")`. Parse the footprint's **first `(at)`** (it precedes all
  pad/property `(at)`s) and accept either layer form — don't anchor on `(footprint "name"`.
- **SIDE (top/bottom) stays in code** (`layer=` on the part) — a hand flip needs footprint mirroring;
  keep that in the `.tsx`, round-trip only x/y/rot.
- **Variants = unique boards from one circuit:** `placement/<release>.json` per release; same topology,
  different floorplan. This is the clean way to ship "a different PCB for each drop."
- **Connectors to the edge:** the round-trip is how you *make* it stick — drag each connector to its
  shell-slot edge (see **pcb-enclosure-fit**), rotate the opening outward, `make sync`. Or seed a
  variant by writing the edge x/y/rot into the json directly.
- **Auto-orient first to untangle the ratsnest** (`make untangle [VARIANT=x]`, `scripts/untangle.mjs`):
  the cheap pre-routing win the autorouter can't give you. Holds positions fixed and rotates each part
  to the 0/90/180/270 that minimises its **signal** nets' wirelength (power/ground dropped — poured,
  high-fanout), iterating to convergence. **Every rotation is gate-checked** (won't push a part off the
  outline or onto a cutout). Measured **~14% shorter signal wirelength, 11 parts reoriented** on
  flexisette. It writes straight to `placement/<variant>.json`, so it's just a seed for the same loop:
  `make untangle` → `make place` (eyeball + hand-tune) → route. HPWL is a proxy — validate the winner
  with a fast route. Pure core is tested (`tests/untangle.test.mjs`); part-level rotation here complements
  `autoplace.mjs`'s block-level position+rotation annealing.

## The measured iteration loop (encode it; don't eyeball it)

**The full-board loop is ONE command: `scripts/route.sh`** — export placement → reconcile nets
(`merge_nets.py`) → keepout the board holes (`add_cutout_keepouts.py`) → **fast** Freerouting (capped) →
add the GND pour + inject the route into KiCad over IPC → `drc_check.py` triage. You read the summary,
nudge **placement** (in code, or by hand in KiCad), and re-run. The whole point is *fast iterations on
PLACEMENT*, not one long route:

- **Cap the router — don't let it grind.** A fast pass (`MP=12`) that leaves many unrouted is a
  *placement* signal: fix the layout, don't burn 10 minutes of ripup-retry hoping the router saves a bad
  floorplan. Freerouting will run hundreds of passes making zero progress — `freeroute.sh` caps
  `-mp`/`-oit` and guards a wall-clock timeout. Grind (`MP=100 OIT=20 bash scripts/route.sh`) is the LAST
  step, once placement is good — not the iteration step.
- **The measure is `drc_check.py`** — it sorts DRC into **PLACEMENT** (courtyard overlaps → fix pcbX/pcbY),
  **ROUTING** (real shorts between distinct nets, crossings, unconnected), **FALSE shorts** (unreconciled
  net fragments → run `merge_nets.py`), and **RULE/FAB/COSMETIC** (global via/clearance, silk).
  **`unconnected` counts as BLOCKING** — before 2026-10-01 it didn't, so `RESULT: CLEAN ✓` could be
  printed with open nets; don't trust an older "CLEAN" without reading the unconnected count. A clean
  placement = 0 courtyard overlaps; a routable placement = low unrouted on a FAST pass.
- **Placement has THREE gates — all separate from routing, all must pass:** (1) **`outline-check.mjs`**
  — every part INSIDE the outline (not in a notch, cutout, reel, or screw hole; tscircuit has no keep-in,
  so `pcbX/pcbY` can drop a part into a hole and only this catches it); (2) **`drc_check.py` courtyard**
  — no part-part overlaps; (3) **low unrouted** on a fast pass. Drive ALL THREE — optimising routability
  alone will happily shove a block into the head notch (it did, on flexisette).
- **⚠ Routing keepouts ≠ placement keep-in.** A DSN keepout (`add_cutout_keepouts.py`) stops *traces*
  crossing a hole — the router's job. It does NOTHING to stop a *part* being placed in the hole/notch.
  A part in a cutout is a PLACEMENT bug (`outline-check` flags it), **never** a Freerouting failure —
  the router only routes, it never moves parts.
- **Round-trip:** placement lives in code (`pcbX/pcbY`), so the loop is *edit code → `route.sh` → read
  DRC*. You can also nudge in KiCad; `route.sh` re-exports from code each run, so persist a KiCad nudge
  back into the source (or it's lost on the next export — tscircuit→KiCad is one-way).
- **Grind the gates IN ORDER: outline → courtyard → unrouted.** Don't chase routability past an invalid
  placement. Worked, on flexisette (cassette: OLED window + 2 reels + 4 screws + a bottom head-notch, all
  keep-out): **12 outline violations → 0** (map regions, narrow the mcu, drop the breakout headers) →
  **14 courtyard overlaps → 0** (drop reset/boot buttons, stack support above the WROOM, spread blocks) →
  **~1 unrouted** with every hole kept out — a fabbable, routable floorplan. ~8 measured iterations, each
  a `outline-check` + `drc_check` + a fast capped route. Pace it: outline-check is build-only (fast);
  only run the route once outline+courtyard are clean.

**Autoplace the BLOCKS — `scripts/autoplace.mjs` (the placement analog of the autorouter).** Placement
is an algorithm, not just vibes, and this is the one spot with no good open tool (KiCad's annealer is
weak; tscircuit's `layoutMode="pack"` stacks on the origin). The shipped placer reads the built
`circuit.json` (per-subcircuit block bboxes + cutouts + the outline polygon + inter-block connectivity
from the `subcircuit_connectivity_map_key`) and **simulated-anneals the block positions (+90° rotation)**
to minimise **HPWL** (inter-block Manhattan wirelength → communicating blocks sit close) under **hard
penalties for the three gates**: block-block overlap, block-on-cutout, and block-outside-outline
(point-in-polygon, so it respects the head-notch). Edge/connector blocks stay put with `--lock`.
```bash
node scripts/autoplace.mjs                 # suggest block pcbX/pcbY (+rot); dry run
node scripts/autoplace.mjs --scramble --write   # from random spreads, restarts, apply the best
```
It gets you a near-valid floorplan in seconds (HPWL-min, parts in-board); **always validate the winner
with `outline-check` + a fast route** (HPWL is only a proxy — the route is ground truth), and expect to
hand-finish the last courtyard overlap or two. The pure geometry/cost/anneal/extract functions are unit-
tested: `node --test tests/autoplace.test.mjs` (10 cases — overlap, point-in-poly incl. notch, cost
penalties, anneal-separates-overlap, lock, extraction). To go further: recursive min-cut bisection to
seed regions, then this anneal; or extend from block-level to per-part.

Placement → routing is also a **per-block loop** (isolate one block's routability before composing).
Make the number cheap to read and refine against it. Three bundled scripts (in `scripts/`) encode the loop; wire them
to Makefile targets (`module`, `routecheck`, `sweep`) and copy `scripts/place.tsx` + `genpinmap.mjs`
into `lib/` + `tools/`:

- **`module-scaffold.sh <name>`** — stamp `modules/<name>.circuit.tsx` with the canonical skeleton
  (`<subcircuit autorouter="sequential-trace">` + `J_<NAME>` breakout + bottom GND pour + standalone
  `<board>` export). Decomposition becomes mechanical instead of a fresh judgement each time.
- **`routecheck.sh [names…]`** — THE metric. Builds each block standalone under `timeout`, prints a
  table of **UNROUTED** (`grep -c 'Could not find a route'` on the build LOG) + **TIME** + **PASS**.
  Ground truth is the log, not "passed"/trace counts. Re-run after every placement change; watch the
  number fall. (`TIMEOUT=180 routecheck.sh` raises the per-block cap.)
- **`place-sweep.mjs <module> <ref> "x,y"…`** — semi-automates the edge-aware search: rewrites one
  part's `pcbX/pcbY`, rebuilds, counts unrouted per candidate, prints the winner, **restores the file**
  (you apply the winning coord deliberately). This is "move the flash to the QSPI edge: 16→3", scripted.

The loop in practice: `routecheck` for a baseline → read the unrouted *net names* (which edge does each
endpoint exit?) → `place-sweep` the offending part across a few edge-aware spots → apply the winner →
`routecheck` again. Stop at 0 or a small, known tail you hand-finish in KiCad. **Every change is
measured, so regressions show immediately** (a "fix" that takes a block 5→6 is caught on the next run).

Gotchas the loop itself taught (baked into the scripts):
- **Log to a FILE and grep it**, never capture `execSync` stdout — big builds overflow the default
  `maxBuffer` (truncates the route-failure tail → false 0) and a non-TTY can buffer differently.
- **Put `bun` on PATH via the child `env`, not a `PATH=… cmd` prefix** — `timeout <dur> PATH=… tsci`
  makes `timeout` exec `"PATH=…"` as the program (env assignments can't follow the command), so every
  build fails to launch → empty log → **false 0 unrouted**. Use `{env:{…PATH}}`.
- A generic `⚠ Build completed with errors` (tsci exits 0) is benign (unconnected NC / mounting pads) —
  PASS on `unrouted==0` + *specific* fatals (`does not have a footprint`, `is not exported`, …), not on
  the word "error".

Worked example: the **flexisette** PCB (`flexisette/pcb/` — cassette-shaped board: ESP32-S3 + SSD1306 +
MAX98357A + TP4056/LiPo). 4 blocks; `routecheck` took the power block 6→3 via two `place-sweep`s that
parked the USB-C CC resistors on their real pads; the residual tail (thermal-pad stitch, a cross-block
USB haul) is KiCad-finish work.

## Finishing the routing tail

`sequential-trace` clears ~80-90% then stalls on dense QFN escapes, ground returns, congested buses.
Two ways to close it:
- **Stay in tscircuit:** `<tracehint offset={{x,y}}/>` to nudge a net, or `<pcbtrace route={[...]}/>` for
  an explicit hand-route in code. Reproducible but tedious (coordinates, immature UX).
- **Hand off to KiCad (recommended for a real board):** `tsci export -f kicad_pcb` carries placement +
  pours + ~80% routing + ratsnest. **But the auto-routed traces are low quality** — expect shorts +
  crossings in the DRC; often it's faster to *keep the placement, rip up the routing, and reroute clean*
  in KiCad than to debug it. KiCad is then the source of truth (one-way).

  **Fixing a handful of residual shorts in the injected route — surgically, not by re-routing:**
  After IPC injection you typically have a *few* `shorting_items` where a Freerouting wire grazes a
  neighboring pad (its own clearance + the SES→KiCad coordinate rounding tips a 45° wire ~10-20 µm into
  an adjacent pad). **Do NOT try to fix these with a board-wide clearance bump and a re-route.** Measured
  on flexisette: a tight board converges at `clearance 150` (0.15 mm) but bumping the DSN default to 250,
  or even the *targeted* `(clearance N (type smd_wire))` to push wires off pads, strands **17-52 nets**
  (it never converges → no SES). Freerouting *does* honor `smd_wire`/`pin_wire` clearance types, but any
  board-wide pad clearance increase makes a dense board unroutable. Instead, **fix each short as an
  obstacle-aware text edit on the `.kicad_pcb`** and re-check with `kicad-cli pcb drc`:
  1. Get the exact short geometry from the DRC JSON (`items[].pos` + descriptions).
  2. **Read the REAL pad/via extents** from the footprints — don't guess. (flexisette gotcha: ESP32-S3
     WROOM castellated pads are **1.5 mm wide in X**, so a "nudge 0.25 mm off the pad center" still landed
     *inside* the pad. And the offending obstacle is often a **via** — Ø0.6 mm, 0.3 mm radius — not a pad.)
  3. Map *every* pad + same-layer copper in the local cluster, then reroute the one wire through a verified
     lane (e.g. thread VBAT through the 0.6 mm gap between a GND pad's edge and a VSYS via's clearance
     ring), keeping ≥ fab clearance (0.127 mm) to each. Reuse the segment UUIDs; preserve net numbers.
  4. Re-run `drc_check.py` after EACH edit — these are congested clusters and a fix often trades one short
     for another until you find the true lane (2-3 iterations is normal). This took flexisette 3 real
     shorts → 0 with placement/keepouts untouched.
- **Route the whole board with Freerouting** (a real maze router — ripup-retry, **45° traces** — that
  reached **0 unrouted, ~18 vias, ~5 s** on flexisette where sequential-trace stalls at ~10). Getting it
  back into KiCad was the catch; there are two ways, **prefer the first:**
  - **Freerouting v2.1.0** (`freert`) — fine for simple **2-layer** boards. Its `-mp`/`-oit` flags are
    **ignored** (runs to a 9999-pass default) and it only writes the `.ses` on **full convergence** —
    oscillates forever + writes NOTHING otherwise (measure from the LOG, not the `.ses`). It also **crashes
    with a maze `NullPointerException` (`TileShape … null`) on some geometry**, so it can never reach 0 on
    boards that trip it. For anything dense or 4-layer, prefer v2.2.4.
  - **Freerouting v2.2.4** (`freert224`, needs **JDK 25** — class file v69; JDK 21 throws
    `UnsupportedClassVersionError`). Install user-local: `curl -fsSL <adoptium temurin 25 jdk> | tar` →
    `~/jdk25`, wrap as `~/.local/bin/freert224`. **This is the better engine and the 4-layer flow**
    (verified on einhander: 107 nets → ~3 unrouted in ~5 s, no NPE). It (a) writes a **PARTIAL `.ses`** so
    you inject + hand-finish the tail, (b) **honors `(type power)` inner layers as planes** — placing the
    power fanout vias and keeping signals on F/B. The old "v2.2.x rejects the tscircuit DSN (`padstack name
    expected at 'V3V3'`)" gotcha is caused by tscircuit's malformed `(wiring)` section — **strip it first**
    with `dsn_4layer_planes.py` (which also relabels the inner layers). See **4-layer flow** below.
  - **IPC injection (headless, recommended)** — `tsci export -f specctra-dsn` → `freeroute.sh <tsx>` →
    `apply_ses_ipc.py <ses> --save --clear`. Injects straight into a running pcbnew; works with
    tscircuit's own DSN; no GUI menus. See *Automate KiCad headless via the IPC API* below — this is the
    flow that finally produced a routed `index.circuit.kicad_pcb` in place.
  - **Specctra GUI round-trip (fallback)** — only if you can't run the IPC server:
    1. **KiCad GUI:** `File ▸ Export ▸ Specctra DSN` → `board.dsn`.
    2. `bash scripts/freeroute.sh board.dsn` → `build/board.ses` (runs `freert` headless).
    3. **KiCad GUI:** `File ▸ Import ▸ Specctra Session` → `build/board.ses` (needs a KiCad-exported DSN).

  **Hard-won gotchas (do NOT re-derive these):**
  - **KiCad's SES import only accepts a session whose DSN KiCad ITSELF exported.** A SES routed from
    *tscircuit's* `tsci export -f specctra-dsn` has foreign net/component ids and **will not import** —
    GUI silently fails, headless `pcbnew.ImportSpecctraSES` throws. So `freeroute.sh <tsx>` is
    **completion-MEASUREMENT only** (good for comparing routers); `freeroute.sh <board.dsn>` is the real one.
  - **Freerouting writes an empty `(host_version )`** which KiCad's specctra parser rejects on import
    ("expecting a symbol or number" at that line). `freeroute.sh` auto-patches it (`sed` → a non-empty
    value); without that the SES won't even parse, regardless of which DSN it came from.
  - **NO automation of the DSN export — period. `pcbnew.ExportSpecctraDSN(board, file)` returns False
    EVERYWHERE:** standalone, under xvfb, AND from a real menu-triggered KiCad action plugin holding the
    correct frame board (verified: plugin logged `run fps=36 … export ok=False`). The SWIG binding is
    non-functional in KiCad 9.0.3 — only the GUI's own `File ▸ Export ▸ Specctra DSN` menu works.
    `kicad-cli` has no specctra command either. So a plugin/script CANNOT export the DSN; steps 1 & 3 are
    irreducibly manual GUI menu actions. Only the `freert` middle (step 2) scripts. Do not waste time on
    plugins, xvfb+xdotool (KiCad ignores synthetic menu input; bare xvfb has no window manager), or
    `wx.CallLater` auto-run (`GetBoard()` is empty off the menu path) — all dead ends, all tried.
    **Not a local fluke:** a KiCad forum thread reported `ExportSpecctraDSN()` "broken in nightly" back in
    **2020**, and the whole SWIG binding is **deprecated as of KiCad 9, removed in KiCad 11** (replaced by
    the **IPC API / `kicad-python`** — which IS the working automation path now; see *Automate KiCad
    headless via the IPC API* below, and just inject the SES with `apply_ses_ipc.py`). Reference KiCad+Freerouting
    automation projects (e.g. B73Labs/clock-skidl, the official freerouting KiCad guide) ALL do the DSN
    export by hand via the GUI menu. The manual export→`freert`→import is the community standard, not a
    workaround — don't keep hunting for a script that doesn't exist.
  - tscircuit's in-tool `autorouter="freerouting"` preset does NOT drive a local Freerouting — it falls
    back (~7 unrouted) and throws copper-pour errors. Don't use it.
  - Freerouting's weak spot is large/dense boards + trace quality, so it's a *finisher* once placement is
    good — it doesn't replace the "good placement → trivial routing" north star.
  - **`auto_cloud` IS hosted Freerouting** (`internal-freerouting.fly.dev`). When up, it routes inside
    tscircuit's pipeline, so `tsci export -f kicad_pcb` comes out routed with no Specctra hand-off at all —
    but it returned HTTP 500s in testing. Local `freert` is the dependable engine; the cloud is a bonus.
  - **Headless SES→board injection now WORKS — via IPC, not SWIG** (`scripts/apply_ses_ipc.py`; see the
    IPC section). The old SWIG `apply_ses.py` (kept only as a cautionary relic) plateaued at ~30 unrouted
    + V3V3↔GND shorts because it guessed nets *geometrically* (union-find) — **that** was the failure, not
    the pour. The IPC tool maps SES nets authoritatively against the live board (`Net-(REF-PadN)` → pad
    `(REF,N)`'s net; `NAME_source_net_N` → net `NAME`) and injects tracks/vias directly into a running
    pcbnew, so the GUI Specctra import is no longer required. The transform is the same verified one
    (`x_nm=u*100+1e8`, `y_nm=1e8−u*100`, `w_nm=w*100`).
  - **4-layer + Freerouting: the planes must be ZONES, not routed nets.** Letting the autorouter route
    GND/PWR as *tracks* is the classic 4-layer failure — it ignores the inner copper and snakes power
    everywhere. Route **signals only**; carry GND/PWR on inner-plane zones + stitch vias. See *Layer
    stackup strategy* below for how to do 4-layer right (it's the lever for high-pin-count parts).

## Automate KiCad headless via the IPC API (the right way)

The old SWIG `pcbnew` bindings are **deprecated (gone in KiCad 11) and `ExportSpecctraDSN` is broken
everywhere** (above), so driving routing from a Python *plugin* is a dead end. The **IPC API
(`kicad-python` / `kipy`, `pip install kipy`)** replaces it and actually works: it drives a *running*
pcbnew over a socket — headless, no menu clicks, and it can even inject a SES that KiCad's own GUI import
rejects. **This is now the primary automation path; the Specctra GUI round-trip is the fallback.**

**Setup (once):**
- `pip install kipy`
- Enable the server: `~/.config/kicad/<ver>/kicad_common.json` → `"api": { "enable_server": true }`.
- **pcbnew must be RUNNING with the board open** — the API needs the live app (socket
  `/tmp/kicad/api.sock`). Launch on a real/virtual display: `DISPLAY=:0 pcbnew board.kicad_pcb &`
  (use `run_in_background` so the agent shell doesn't reap it).
- Connect: `import kipy; b = kipy.KiCad().get_board()`.

**What it gives you that SWIG could not** (all on the live board, then `b.save()`):
`b.create_items([...])` (add `Track`/`Via`/`Zone`), `b.refill_zones()` (the pour refill every edit needs),
`b.remove_items([...])` (rip up for a clean reroute), `b.get_nets/get_pads/get_footprints/get_shapes/get_zones`.

**The shipped tools (`scripts/`, proven on flexisette — board routed in place, 0 unmapped nets):**
- **`add_plane.py <NET> <LAYER> [--replace] [--priority N]`** — add a ground/power plane zone. *Required*
  because tscircuit's `<copperpour>` is dropped on export (0 zones — see pitfalls). Builds a rectangle
  clipped to the board outline on fill, refills, saves, and **warns if it filled as >1 island** (a
  fragmented pour = orphaned ground).
- **`apply_ses_ipc.py <ses> --save [--clear]`** — inject a Freerouting SES into the live board: the
  headless replacement for `File ▸ Import ▸ Specctra Session`, and unlike the GUI it **accepts a SES
  routed from tscircuit's own DSN** (foreign ids and all). `--clear` rips up existing routing first.

**Fully-automated routing flow (no GUI menu clicks):**
1. `tsci export -f kicad_pcb` → placement; open it: `DISPLAY=:0 pcbnew index.circuit.kicad_pcb &`.
2. `python3 scripts/add_plane.py GND B.Cu --replace` (2-layer) — or inner GND/PWR planes (4-layer).
3. `tsci export -f specctra-dsn` → `bash scripts/freeroute.sh <tsx>` → `build/*.ses` (freert routes it).
4. `python3 scripts/apply_ses_ipc.py build/<board>.ses --save --clear` → tracks+vias injected, zones
   refilled, board saved **in place** — the routed `index.circuit.kicad_pcb` you actually wanted.
5. `kicad-cli pcb drc index.circuit.kicad_pcb` → triage the tail (DRC rulesets + pitfalls below).

**Why `apply_ses_ipc.py` is clean where the old SWIG `apply_ses.py` was not:**
- **Net assignment is AUTHORITATIVE, not geometric** (geometric/union-find is what caused the old
  V3V3↔GND short storms). SES names map directly: `Net-(REF-PadN)` → the net of kipy pad `(REF,N)`;
  `NAME_source_net_<n>` → net `NAME` (GND/V3V3/SCL/…). On flexisette: 0 unmapped of 45 net blocks.
- **Transform verified exact** (DSN units → KiCad nm): `x_nm = u*100 + 1e8`, `y_nm = 1e8 − u*100`,
  `w_nm = w*100` (resolution `um 10` = 10000 u/mm; +100 mm board offset; Specctra Y-up vs KiCad Y-down).
- **Via sizes come from the padstack name** (`Via[0-1]_600:300_um` → 0.6/0.3 mm). Forgetting this makes
  every via inherit KiCad's default → `via_diameter`/`annular_width` DRC storm (a real bug, now fixed in
  the tool). Tracks carry width from the SES `(path layer width …)`.

**Caveat:** the IPC server needs a live KiCad GUI process — launch it on a real/virtual display first;
after that there are zero menu clicks. (SWIG `ExportSpecctraDSN`, xvfb+xdotool menu poking, and
`wx.CallLater` plugin auto-run are all dead ends — see above, don't revisit.)

## Layer stackup strategy — the high-pin-count lever

Layer count is a *placement-difficulty* decision — the cheapest lever after placement itself:

- **2-layer + one ground pour** — default for low/medium density. Pour GND on **one** layer and bias
  signals onto the **other**. A full-board pour on a layer that *also* carries signals gets **chopped into
  islands** by those signals (measured: a B.Cu GND pour over B.Cu signals on flexisette filled as **3
  disconnected islands** → orphaned ground). `add_plane.py`'s island check catches this. Alternative:
  per-block pours (a board-spanning pour can fight bottom-layer signals — see pitfalls).
- **4-layer (Sig / GND / PWR / Sig)** — the lever that makes **high-pin-count parts routable** (dense
  QFN/BGA, ESP32-class modules, many buses). Dedicated **inner GND and PWR planes** mean both outer layers
  stay free for signal escape, and every power/ground pin reaches its plane with **one short stitch via**
  — no GND/PWR snaking as tracks (what congests and finally defeats 2-layer on dense parts).

  **Do it the right way (this is where 4-layer usually goes wrong):**
  1. Set the board to 4 copper layers (Board Setup ▸ Physical Stackup); assign **In1 = GND, In2 = PWR**.
  2. Add the planes as **zones**: `add_plane.py GND In1.Cu --replace` and `add_plane.py V3V3 In2.Cu
     --replace`. On a dedicated plane layer (no signals) they fill as **1 island** — the check confirms it.
  3. **Let Freerouting route GND/PWR *as normal nets*, then carry them on the planes + finish the corners.**
     ⚠️ CORRECTED (einhander, verified — this reverses earlier advice): the three "obvious" ways to keep
     GND/PWR off the signal layers all FAIL, so don't reach for them first:
     - *Relabel inner layers `(type power)` and leave GND/PWR in the netlist* → Freerouting can't use the
       inner layers so it snakes GND/PWR as **hundreds of tracks on F.Cu/B.Cu anyway** (einhander: 156 GND +
       98 V3V3 segments). The relabel only stops *signals* on the inner layers; it does NOT make the router
       fanout power pins to the plane.
     - *Drop GND/PWR from the routed netlist entirely* (`dsn_drop_nets.py`) → discrete two-pin decaps are
       fine (via-in-pad), but **fine-pitch QFN power pins are STRANDED**: a JLC-legal 0.6 mm via won't fit on
       a 0.5 mm-pitch pad, and their short pin→decap *dogbone escapes* — which only an autorouter places —
       are gone too (einhander: 42 signals routed clean, but 18 QFN/decap power pads left unconnected).
     - *Declare DSN `(plane GND …)`* → Freerouting 2.2.4 *parses* it (has `io/specctra/parser/Plane.class`)
       but **won't fanout pads to it**: 0 plane vias, ~48 nets left unrouted. Its plane mode is a no-op here.
  4. So the recipe that actually converged: **keep GND/PWR in the route** (the QFN dogbones get placed),
     `add_plane.py` the inner zones, inject the SES, then **convert only the dense/short-prone corners**
     to plane-vias with a DRC-verified finisher (⚠️ on einhander the "short-prone LDO corner" turned out to
     be the mixed-side DSN bug, not density — run `dsn_split_sides.py` first and re-check before
     hand-patching any corner), and give the **QFN a LOCAL
     GND pour** (`add_local_zone.py U1 GND F.Cu`) so its ground pins tie into copper on their own layer and
     stitch down through the GND vias already there. Every GND/PWR pin ends on the plane; the only signal-
     layer power copper left is unavoidable short escapes, not cross-board snaking.

  Net effect: a brutal QFN escape becomes "drop a via to the plane" + a short run on a clear outer layer.
  That is the entire reason to spend the extra two layers.

  **The working 4-layer flow (one command: `scripts/route4.sh`, verified on einhander — RP2040 USB-MIDI,
  43-pin GND + 24-pin V3V3 that 2-layer Freerouting could never route):**
  1. `<board layers={4}>` in tscircuit → `tsci export -f {kicad_pcb,specctra-dsn}` (all 4 layers export
     as `(type signal)`, plus a malformed `(wiring)` section of pre-placed power vias).
  2. **`scripts/dsn_4layer_planes.py <dsn> --no-planes --relabel-power`** — strips the `(wiring)` section
     (the `padstack name expected at 'V3V3'` parse-breaker) AND relabels the inner layers `(type power)`
     so signals stay on F.Cu/B.Cu. (This keeps *signals* off the inner planes — it does NOT, on its own,
     move GND/PWR onto them; see the corrected step 3 above.)
  2a. **`scripts/dsn_split_sides.py <kicad_pcb> <dsn>`** — un-mirror parts that share a footprint with a
     part on the OTHER side (tscircuit dedupes DSN images by footprint name — see
     [Mixed-side footprints](#mixed-side-footprints-the-dsn-mirrors-top-side-parts) below). Runs on
     system `/usr/bin/python3` (needs KiCad's `pcbnew`). Idempotent; a no-op on single-sided boards.
  2b. **`scripts/add_npth_keepouts.py <kicad_pcb> <dsn>`** and **`scripts/add_cutout_keepouts.py`** — keepout
     every mechanical hole so no trace crosses a drilled hole (see the NPTH-keepout note below — this bit
     einhander AND flexisette).
  3. **`freert224`** (v2.2.4 + JDK 25) routes it — GND/PWR route as tracks + power vias; the inner planes
     carry them once poured. (v2.1.0 can't: ignores `(type power)`, NPE-crashes, never writes a partial.)
  4. KiCad: `add_plane.py GND In1.Cu --replace` + `add_plane.py V3V3 In2.Cu --replace` (solid zones the
     power vias land in) → `apply_ses_ipc.py <ses> --save --clear` → **`check_floating.py`** (catches
     wrong-side pads — see below) → `drc_check.py`.
  - **Gotcha order that bit on einhander:** run `drc_check.py` (courtyard) BEFORE celebrating — tight
    decoupling/passive placement causes courtyard overlaps that bridge pads into **real GND/PWR shorts**;
    `outline-check` won't catch them. Fix the overlaps in code, re-run `route4.sh` (it's ~30 s end-to-end).

  **Dense high-pin-count placement heuristics (hard-won on einhander's RP2040 — the tail shrank from
  PLACEMENT, never from smarter finishers):**
  - **Budget generous board area; density is the real lever.** RP2040 + flash + xtal + ~15 caps + USB-C +
    LDO jammed into a 13 mm band sat right at Freerouting's wall (~12 nets unrouted, tail nets varying per
    run). Widening the band to ~19–25 mm (and pushing the key matrix forward) dropped it to ~5 — the single
    highest-leverage move. When a QFN's tail won't close, **make room before you touch a finisher.**
  - **On 4-layer, keep decoupling OFF the under-QFN escape.** Bottom-side caps directly under the QFN block
    B.Cu signal escape (QSPI/USB stall). Put them in rows ABOVE/BELOW the chip (leave |x|,|y| < ~4.5 mm clear).
  - **USB-C CC/power corner is intrinsically hard — spread it.** CC resistors go on the **bottom, under the
    connector** (via straight behind each CC pin); spread the LDO + its caps into open band space; never
    cluster power at the connector (every wire crosses the 0.5 mm-pitch pad row → shorts).
  - **Freerouting's tail moves with ANY input change — freeze one baseline, don't nudge-and-reroll.** Each
    re-route after a placement/DSN change reshuffles the whole board and the tail *moves* (10→15→6→9).
    (The same DSN re-routed gave the same result 3/3 times on einhander, 2026-10-01 — it's the *input*
    perturbation, not run-to-run noise, that moves the tail.) Iterating placement + re-routing chases a
    moving target; once a run comes out `RESULT: CLEAN ✓` (0 shorts/crossings) with a small unconnected
    tail, STOP re-routing and finish THAT board deterministically.
  - **Finishing a congested corner by adding copper shorts things.** A through-via's B.Cu ring bridges a
    nearby track; a straight pad-to-pad track crosses the connector pads. So a finisher must be
    **DRC-verified**: `scripts/finish_iter.py` tries each stitch via in several offset directions/distances
    and KEEPS only the placement that adds no short/crossing (DRC as oracle); leaves a pad unconnected
    rather than shorting. `scripts/fanout_planes.py` is the blind (fast) version — use it only in open space.
  - **kipy gotchas:** `b.create_items(x)` returns server handles — pass THOSE to `b.remove_items`, not your
    originals (else "no valid items to delete"). And the IPC server dies easily between shell calls — do all
    kipy work in ONE process/bash call, relaunching pcbnew at the top. Also: a point-to-point finisher must
    add a VIA when the two SMD pads are on the same side and it routes on the *other* layer — an F.Cu pad +
    a bare B.Cu track connects NOTHING (and passes a shorts-only DRC check as a false "OK"). Verify the
    finisher reduced `unconnected`, not just that shorts stayed flat.
  - **One net that won't cross a congested corridor → JUMPER, don't fight it.** If a single net (classically
    a power net like VBUS threading past the LDO's V3V3/GND, or an escape past a connector's pad row) can't
    be routed without crossing other copper no matter the path, place a **0 Ω jumper** (a real resistor part)
    or a **DNP wire-jumper** on it: route the blocked net up to the jumper and let the crossing traffic pass
    on the same layer through the gap beneath it — you pick the ONE crossing point deliberately. Cheaper and
    more reliable than hand-threading or re-placing the whole corner. (For a pure power net with few pads,
    the equivalent is a small local **copper pour/zone** for that net in the corner instead of a thin trace.)

### Mixed-side footprints: the DSN mirrors top-side parts

**The bug that kept einhander from ever routing clean unattended.** tscircuit's `specctra-dsn` export
dedupes `(image …)` by footprint NAME. The FIRST instance defines it — so if that one is
`layer="bottom"`, the image gets **mirrored pin X and `[B]` (B.Cu) padstacks**, and every TOP-side part
with the same footprint inherits them. The `.kicad_pcb` export is correct per part, so the two files
disagree and nothing warns you. Freerouting routes the DSN's version: B.Cu traces to the *opposite* pads,
no via. After SES injection that reads as **unconnected pads + cross-net shorts + dangling stubs** clustered
on a few innocent-looking parts — which looks exactly like "a dense corner the router can't handle".
- einhander: bottom-side decap C11 (0805) defined the image; top-side C_IN / C_OUT / C_LED (also 0805)
  inherited it → the raw unattended run had **1 short (VBUS↔RUN) + 6 unconnected + 3 dangling**, all on
  those three caps. The shipped board had hand-patched them by coordinate (`fix_ldo_planes.py`,
  `patch_stragglers.py`), blaming the router.
- **Fix: `scripts/dsn_split_sides.py <board.kicad_pcb> <dsn>`** (route4.sh step 2a). Compares every DSN pin
  in ABSOLUTE board coordinates (place + rotated image pin) against pcbnew's absolute pad position + copper
  side, and gives any part that disagrees a private image rebuilt from the KiCad pads (+ a side-swapped
  padstack clone). Compare in absolute coords — a rotated QFN (einhander U1 at −90°) stores pad offsets in
  a different local frame in the two files and falsely "mismatches" if you compare locally.
- Result on einhander: **0 shorts, 0 dangling, 2 unconnected, zero hand steps** (from 1/6/3), ~30 s.
- **Diagnostic signature:** every defect involves the same few 2-pin parts, and each net's track ends on
  the part's *other* pad, on the other layer. If you see that, suspect the DSN, not the router.

### Freerouting tail dead-ends (tried on einhander 2026-10-01 — don't repeat)

- **A net can silently vanish from the SES.** After the side fix, Freerouting 2.2.4 omitted QSPI_SCLK
  from the session entirely (no wires at either pad) while reporting the run complete — deterministic,
  3/3 runs. Only `drc_check` (unconnected) catches it; the router log won't.
- **Incremental tail pass with frozen wiring hangs 2.2.4.** Writing the previous SES back into the DSN
  as `(wiring … (type fix|protect|route))` so a second pass only routes the open nets: Freerouting stalls
  after 0–2 passes even with only 10 frozen wires (vias alone are fine). Not a usable tail strategy.
- **Freerouting v2.4.1 is worse here:** 1376 violations, ~90 s per optimizer pass, no SES in 200 s.
  Stay on 2.2.4.
- So the tail (≤ a few nets) is a hand-route in KiCad or a DRC-verified finisher (`finish_converge.py`),
  not another router pass.

### Two traps that pass a shorts-only check but break the board (einhander + flexisette)

- **Traces routed THROUGH mechanical holes.** An NPTH hole (keyswitch pole/alignment pins, USB-C mount
  posts, board screw holes) has **no copper**, so Freerouting sees no obstacle and routes a track straight
  across it — then the drill removes the copper and the net is **open**. This is invisible to a casual look
  and hit BOTH einhander (11 traces across keyswitch/USB holes) and flexisette. `add_cutout_keepouts.py`
  only keepouts interior **Edge.Cuts** shapes; mechanical holes are **pads**, so they need
  **`scripts/add_npth_keepouts.py <kicad_pcb> <dsn> --margin 0.3 --min-hole 0.5`** — it finds every
  `np_thru_hole` pad, computes its world position, and writes a per-copper-layer keepout (hole radius +
  margin) into the DSN before routing. Run it in the DSN-prep step of *every* board that has mounting holes.
  A keepout radius of hole/2 + 0.3 mm clears the drill without blocking the part's own electrical pins
  (they sit outside it). Gate it: after routing, `kicad-cli drc` **`hole_clearance` with `actual 0.000 mm`
  is a track crossing a hole** — a real defect, not cosmetic (drc_check buckets hole_clearance as
  fab/cosmetic, so read the actual value).

- **Wrong-side / floating SMD pad.** An SMD pad lives on ONE copper layer, but Freerouting sometimes routes
  its net on the OTHER layer and never drops a fanout via — so the pad is reached only by opposite-side
  copper and is **electrically floating** even though a 2D plot "looks" connected (a top-side cap with only
  back-layer traces going to it). **`scripts/check_floating.py <board>`** flags every SMD pad whose only
  same-net copper is on the wrong layer with no via, and exits nonzero — run it as a gate right after
  `apply_ses_ipc`, alongside `drc_check`. (It's orthogonal to DRC-unconnected: a pad can be "reached on its
  own layer" per check_floating yet still be an unconnected island per DRC — run both.)

### Fanning GND/PWR pads to the plane WITHOUT shorting (collision-aware, not blind)

When you connect plane-net pads to their inner plane with vias, **blind placement shorts on dense boards**:
a via dropped at a fixed offset + a stub trace lands on a neighbouring signal (einhander: 33 plane-vs-signal
shorts from `fanout_planes.py`'s naive offset). Two rules:
- **Prefer VIA-IN-PAD** — a through-via at the pad centre. The pad is already that net's copper, so it adds
  no signal-layer trace and can't cross a neighbour on the pad's own layer; the zone refill carves the
  antipad in the *other* plane automatically. Only when via-in-pad is geometrically blocked (a foreign track
  under/over the pad) do you offset — and then **clearance-check the via point AND the pad→via stub against
  all foreign copper on both outer layers before accepting it** (`fanout_planes.py` now does this; it leaves
  a pad unconnected and reports it rather than creating a short).
- **Via-in-pad won't fit fine-pitch QFN pins** (0.6 mm via on 0.5 mm pitch touches the neighbour). Those
  need either a routed dogbone escape (leave them in the autorouter's netlist) or a **local pour** over the
  QFN (`add_local_zone.py <ref> GND F.Cu`) that the pins tie into on their own layer.
- **Don't hardcode finisher coordinates.** `fix_ldo_planes.py` pinned a VBUS rail at a literal (x,y); a fresh
  re-route moved the rail and the trace dangled. Derive endpoints from the live board (nearest same-net
  copper), or re-derive after every re-route. (And that whole script existed only to paper over the
  mixed-side DSN bug — a finisher that needs literal coordinates is usually hiding an upstream bug.)
- **kipy over IPC dies between shell calls** — launch pcbnew and do all kipy work in ONE bash call
  (`scripts/apply_fix.sh <script> [args]` handles this: launches pcbnew, waits for `/tmp/kicad/api.sock`,
  runs the script, logs to a file that survives a hard kill, then kills pcbnew).
- **`board.get_tracks()` does NOT return vias — use `board.get_vias()`.** Iterating `get_tracks()` and
  filtering `isinstance(t, Via)` silently matches nothing, so via-deletion/inspection code no-ops without
  error (it bit einhander's DFM hole-spacing fix — a via 0.04 mm from a mounting hole "wouldn't delete").
  `create_items([via])` still adds vias fine; only reading them back needs `get_vias()`.

## DRC rulesets (default: JLCPCB)

Make the board legal for whoever fabs it. Rulesets live in `rules/` (**JLCPCB is the default**) and
have **two sides** — generation and checking are different tools:

- **Source side** — spread a `rules/fab.tsx` preset into every `<board>` AND `<subcircuit>` (each block
  has its own autorouter, so a board-level prop alone won't reach within-block geometry) so generated
  **tracks** are fab-legal: `import { JLCPCB } from "../lib/fab"` → `<board {...JLCPCB}>` /
  `<subcircuit {...JLCPCB}>`. ⚠ the sequential-trace autorouter honors `minTraceWidth` but **ignores the
  via-size props** — vias export as 0.3/0.2 regardless, so fix vias KiCad-side.
- **Check side** — set **Board Setup ▸ Constraints** + the Default net class to the fab's mins (this is
  what *loosens* KiCad's stricter defaults — the source of most "hundreds of via violations"), load
  `rules/<fab>.kicad_dru` for the stricter-than-default rules, and **resize all vias** to the fab size
  (select all ▸ properties). tscircuit's 0.2 mm-drill vias are below JLC's 0.3 mm min — a real fix, not a
  false positive.

`rules/README.md` has the per-fab capability table (JLCPCB / PCBWay / OSH Park) and how to add a fab
(a `fab.tsx` preset + a `<fab>.kicad_dru` + a table row).

## Pitfalls (hard-won)

- **Monolith** → 100% CPU forever, 0 traces. Split into `<subcircuit>` blocks. Always cap builds with
  `timeout 120 ...` so a stall can't thrash the machine.
- **Default capacity-mesh router** fails/hangs at any size → `autorouter="sequential-trace"`.
- **"X does not have a footprint"** (fatal under sequential-trace) → footprint on every part incl.
  headers/buttons; import a real USB-C part (builtin `usb_c` has none).
- **`--disable-parts-engine`** is fast but strips `<connector standard="usb_c">` of its ports → use a real
  imported USB-C part so the block builds offline.
- **`tsci --help`/`check` print nothing** (TTY-gated) → use `tsci build` (writes `dist/.../circuit.json`,
  `pcb.svg`) and read those.
- **`pkill -f tsci` kills your own shell** (its cmdline contains "tsci") → match the exact subcommand /
  use stored PIDs. Killing the `timeout` wrapper leaves a **re-parented `bun`** running → `pkill -9 -f
  'bun .*tsci build'`.
- **Trace counts and "passed" lie** → `grep -c 'Could not find a route'`; on KiCad, `kicad-cli pcb drc`.
- **Copper pours — a recurring source of pain. Specifically:**
  - **tscircuit `<copperpour>` does NOT survive `tsci export -f kicad_pcb`.** The exported board has
    **zero zones** even though every module declares a pour (verify: `grep -c '(zone' board.kicad_pcb` →
    0). So a board you *think* has a ground plane has none, and every router is forced to snake GND as
    tracks — the dense/4-layer killer, and the real root cause of past "GND short storms." **Add the
    pour/plane KiCad-side** with `scripts/add_plane.py` (IPC); don't trust the source `<copperpour>`.
  - **A full-board pour on a layer that also carries signals fragments into islands.** Measured on
    flexisette: a B.Cu GND pour over B.Cu signals filled as **3 disconnected islands** → orphaned ground
    → false "unconnected"/short DRC. Bias signals off the pour layer (2-layer), use **per-block** pours,
    or move ground to a **dedicated inner plane** (4-layer — see Layer stackup strategy). `add_plane.py`
    warns when a plane fills as >1 island so you catch it immediately.
  - **Refill zones after ANY track edit.** Ripping/adding tracks (or a programmatic save) leaves zones
    unfilled → every pad returning through the pour reads "unconnected" in DRC. Headless via IPC:
    `b.refill_zones()` before `b.save()` (the shipped tools do this). GUI: `B`. Always DRC *after* refill.
  - **Headless SES injection IS now clean — via IPC, not SWIG.** The old `apply_ses.py` (SWIG) plateaued
    at ~30 unrouted + V3V3↔GND shorts because it guessed nets *geometrically*; that was the failure, not
    the pour. `apply_ses_ipc.py` maps nets authoritatively against the live board and injects directly —
    no GUI Specctra import required. (Note: since tscircuit's DSN has no pour either, Freerouting's SES
    carries full GND *tracks*; with a KiCad-side pour added too, those are redundant copper, never the
    sole ground path — so a missed GND stub can't orphan a pad.)
  - **Verify the pour is one unbroken island** that actually reaches every GND pad (thin necks and
    keepouts can orphan a region) — a filled-but-disconnected pour looks fine and routes nothing.
- **Interior board holes (window / reels / screw holes) get dropped, then routed across.** Two separate
  failures: (1) a board outline imported as a single outer ring **loses its interior holes** — recover
  them from the CAD source of truth (e.g. `panel._rings()` returns `ext` + `holes`) and re-add each as a
  `<cutout>` (rect / circle / polygon; tscircuit DOES export `<cutout>` to Edge.Cuts, as a polygon). (2)
  tscircuit's `<cutout>` is an Edge.Cuts hole but **NOT a routing keepout in the DSN**, so Freerouting
  routes traces straight across the window — run **`add_cutout_keepouts.py`** (auto-detects every closed
  Edge.Cuts loop inside the outer outline → per-layer DSN keepouts). ⚠ holes in the CENTRE split the
  board (see placement: communicating blocks on the same side).
- **Exported via geometry trips KiCad's default DRC** (via_diameter/drill/annular ×N) → one global
  design-rule fix, not N real errors.
- **Decoupling at the pins crowds QFN escape** → put it `layer="bottom"` under the chip.
- **Schematic symbols overlap** without `schX/schY`/`<schematicsection>` — cosmetic, fix late.
- **Reused module refdes collide on compose** → **duplicate reference designators** in the exported
  board (KiCad warns on open; breaks the fab BOM/CPL — designators must be unique). Modules that each
  name parts `U1`/`C1`/`R1` clash when composed. Give every instantiated part a GLOBALLY-unique refdes
  (sbs-synth did: mcu `U1/U2`, audio `U4`, power `U5`). Quick check headless:
  `python3 -c "import sys;sys.path.insert(0,'/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages');import pcbnew,collections;b=pcbnew.LoadBoard('x.kicad_pcb');print([r for r,n in collections.Counter(f.GetReference() for f in b.GetFootprints()).items() if n>1])"`.
  (Separately, tscircuit emits one benign 0-pad `tscircuit:Unknown` footprint with an empty ref per
  `<cutout>` — harmless, never in the BOM; ignore or strip post-export.)
- **Shared signals fragment into multiple nets → FALSE "shorting_items" after routing.** With modular
  breakout headers + top-level pin-to-pin buses (`<trace from=".mcu .J_IO .SDA" to=".display .J_OLED
  .SDA"/>`), tscircuit assigns a *different* net name on each side of the shared header pin: one signal
  ends up as e.g. `SDA`, `U1.IO8 to J_IO.SDA`, and `.mcu .J_IO .SDA to .display .J_OLED .SDA`. Once
  routed, KiCad sees same-signal copper under different net names and flags `shorting_items` (and false
  `unconnected`). On flexisette ~19 of 23 "shorts" were this (every I2C/I2S/USB/V3V3 bus). **The fix:
  drive shared signals/buses through explicit named nets** (`net.SDA`, `net.SCL`, `net.V3V3`) so each is
  ONE net end-to-end; reserve pin-to-pin `<trace>` for genuinely point-to-point links. To tell false
  from real: a real short pairs *distinct* signals (e.g. `VSYS`/`GND`, or a signal crossing a pad) — only
  a handful, and those are the finish-the-tail cases (move the part / reroute the offending track).
- **Thermal/EPAD pads import as a SPLIT grid — tie EVERY sub-pad to GND, not just the first.** A module
  or QFN exposed pad (e.g. ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 EPAD = pin 41, or a QFN center) comes in as several paste
  sub-pads (pin41, plus `pin42…49` etc.). Connecting only the named one (`U1.GND3`/`U1.pin41`) leaves the
  rest floating → "unconnected" in DRC and a poorly-grounded part. Trace `U1.pin42…pinN` to `net.GND`
  too (verify with the per-footprint pad-net dump). The router/pour then stitches vias down. (Unused
  GPIOs staying unconnected is fine — that's intentional.)
- Render SVG→PNG to actually see it: `convert -background black -density 170 dist/<...>/pcb.svg out.png`.

## Verify every board

- `grep -c 'Could not find a route'` per block = 0 (or a known, hand-routed tail).
- `kicad-cli pcb drc <f>.kicad_pcb` on the export: triage `unconnected_items` (route them) vs
  `tracks_crossing`/`shorting_items` (real — rip up & reroute) vs via-rule (global config).
- Decap caps actually land on their pins (check `pcb_component.center` vs `pinmap.json`).
- All assembled parts are JLCPCB-stocked; `imports/*` pin the LCSC numbers.
- **Final DFM gate — `scripts/dfm_check.py <board>` (run before ordering; `make_fab.sh` runs it as
  step [0]).** KiCad's default DRC does NOT enforce fab **hole-to-hole spacing**, so a finisher via
  dropped next to a connector/keyswitch/screw hole *passes DRC* but is a JLCPCB DFM "plated through-hole
  spacing" danger — the two drills break into each other (einhander shipped a GND via **0.04 mm** from a
  USB-C mount hole that DRC never flagged). `dfm_check` flags plated hole-to-hole EDGE < 0.5 mm and via
  drill/annular below JLC min, and **splits ACTIONABLE inter-part** violations (move/reroute the via —
  `fix_hole_spacing.py` deletes it, `reconnect_j14.py` re-fanouts the pad clear of holes *and* copper, or
  ties a boxed-in pad to a nearby grounded thru-hole with a short trace) from **part-inherent
  intra-footprint** ones (a USB-C connector's own mount-post-to-pad spacing — informational; the fab still
  builds it). **NOT a defect: silkscreen over pads/holes + sub-0.15 mm silk lines** — JLC auto-clips silk
  around every opening, so it never affects copper/drill; don't block a build on the DFM report's
  silkscreen "Danger" count (at worst a refdes prints partially).

## Fabrication bundle (Gerbers + drill + CPL + BOM)

Once DRC is clean, **`scripts/make_fab.sh <board.kicad_pcb> [name]`** produces the whole upload
bundle into `fab/`:
- **Gerbers** (all copper incl. inner planes `.g1/.g2`, mask, silk, paste, edge) + gerber-job, and
  **Excellon drill** — via `kicad-cli pcb export gerbers|drill`; zipped as `<name>-gerbers.zip`.
- **CPL / placement** `<name>-cpl.csv` — `kicad-cli pcb export pos --format csv --units mm --side both`.
- **BOM** `<name>-bom.csv` — **`scripts/gen_bom.py`** parses the board's `(Reference,Value,Footprint)`,
  maps a LCSC # to each (ICs from `imports/*.tsx` `supplierPartNumbers`; passives from a table of
  stock-checked JLCPCB **basic** parts), groups identical parts, and flags hand-solder/mechanical
  parts (keyswitches, headers, tactiles) with a blank LCSC + Note so you set them Do-Not-Place.

`make_fab.sh <board> [name] [jlcpcb|pcbway|both]` — the **Gerbers + CPL are shared** across fabs; only
the BOM format differs, so both are generated by default:
- **JLCPCB** (`--fab jlcpcb`) sources by **LCSC** → columns `Comment, Designator, Footprint, JLCPCB Part #`.
- **PCBWay** (`--fab pcbway`) sources by **manufacturer part number** → columns `Item#, Designator, Qty,
  Comment, Footprint, Manufacturer Part Number, Manufacturer, LCSC Part No` (LCSC kept as a cross-ref).
  `gen_bom.py`'s IC_INFO maps the sanitized tscircuit Value to a real MPN + manufacturer; the passive
  table carries LCSC+MPN+mfr together. OSHPark/Aisler are bare-fab (no assembly) → just the Gerber zip.
Gotchas that throw JLC's "error processing BOM": an extra column, blank part-number rows, or non-ASCII
(`Ω`/`µ`) — so the BOM is assembled-parts-only, exact columns, ASCII (`10k` not `10kΩ`); hand-solder parts
go to `<name>-handsolder.csv`. Also `zip *.gbr *.drl` MISSES the real copper layers (KiCad names them
`.gtl/.gbl/.g1/.g2/.gts/...`) — match by the full extension list (make_fab.sh does).

### Selectable local routing and live progress

Both Freerouting and [FastRoute](https://github.com/parisxmas/fastroute) are supported.
FastRoute is optional: download the matching official local CLI release and set
`FASTROUTE_BIN=/absolute/path/to/fastroute`; no design upload is needed. Freerouting
remains the default (`FREERT=/absolute/path/to/freert`, with its required Java version).

```bash
python3 scripts/route_dsn.py build/board.dsn -o build/candidate.ses \
  --backend fastroute --board /absolute/path/board.kicad_pcb \
  --max-time 120 --max-passes 12 --min-trace-width-um 127
# Use the board/fab minimum for the FastRoute neckdown floor above.
# --backend freerouting selects the existing backend.
# Existing pipelines: ROUTER=fastroute FASTROUTE_BIN=/path/fastroute bash scripts/route4.sh
```

Choose a fresh output path for each direct run. The runner writes a log and, for
FastRoute, its native JSON report. With `--board`, it atomically updates
`board.kicad_pcb.routing.json`; the viewer displays progress automatically while visible.
Saved board changes also refresh without another `open_board`, retaining the view,
zoom, layers, marker visibility and netlist filter. No expensive DRC runs on unchanged polls.
A DSN session/checkpoint is **only a candidate**: import it, refill zones, and run
`check_board`; router violation counts are not KiCad DRC results. Neither backend
promises full routing. Keep placement/routing iteration and all completion gates.

For an existing native KiCad board, FastRoute's official repository includes
`integrations/kicad/plugins/route_cli.py` for local headless export, routing and import.
Its `--export-only --work-dir build/native` produces a DSN usable by either backend.
Native `pcbnew.ExportSpecctraDSN` and `ImportSpecctraSES` were verified with KiCad
9.0.8; older-version failures described above remain version-specific fallbacks.
Do not assume that every custom KiCad rule can be represented by DSN.
